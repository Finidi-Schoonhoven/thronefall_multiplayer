# Thronefall Multiplayer

## ARCHIVE NOTICE
This repository is currently archived due to having no time to maintain it on my end.
I invite anyone to fork it, release their own version and do whatever they want with it as long as they give credit.
There are currently no plans on my end to come back to this but that may change.

## Information
This is the development repository for the WIP Thronefall Multiplayer mod.
It uses BepInEx to inject code into the game.

## Development Setup

This is written in CSharp so you will have to acquire an IDE that can read .sln files (for example JetBrains Rider)
You will also need an installation of Thronefall, run the setup.ps1 script to acquire all required dlls from your installation.
After that open the solution file and run the build.

## How to Run

Download BepInEx 6 and copy it into your Thronefall directory.
When you run the build it copies the ThronefallMultiplayer dlls to the correct plugin folder.
Run your executable either directly or through Steam.
